Race to Twelve is a minigame my old C++ professor told us to create. It's a game about you going against an "AI" to get a score of 12.

## How the game works

The player and the "AI" take turns to select a number from 1-3. The number they select will be added to the "total number," and the player's goal is to get a score of 12 and prevent the AI from doing so.

*In this image, the current 'number' is six (6). It's the player's turn. The safest thing to do here is select two (2) and the current score will be eight (8). The AI will randomly pick from the three numbers, and after its turn, the score will either be nine (9), ten (10), or eleven (12). The player can then choose the right number to win.*
