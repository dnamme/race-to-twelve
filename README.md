Race to Twelve is a minigame my old C++ professor told us to create. It's a game about you going against an "AI".

## How the game works

The player and the "AI" take turns to select a number from 1-3. The number they select will be added to the "total number," and the player's goal is to get a score of 12 and prevent the AI from doing so.
